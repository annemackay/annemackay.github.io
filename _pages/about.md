I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.uqam.ca) at UQAM, in Montreal, Canada. 

My research interests are at the intersection of actuarial science and mathematical finance. My work is structured around the pricing and hedging of long-term financial guarantees and hybrid insurance products. I am also interested in the development of numerical methods that find applications in actuarial and financial mathematics.

I am a member of [Quantact](http://quantact.uqam.ca/index_en.php), the Actuarial and Financial Mathematics Research Lab of the [CRM](http://www.crm.umontreal.ca/en/).
